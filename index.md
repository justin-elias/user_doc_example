  -------------------------------------
Learn how to create beautifully formatted documents using Markdown coupled with Sublime Text 3.

## Markdown
--------

Markdown is quickly becoming the go to language when developers and
non-developers want to create rich formatted web documents. But because
of the goal of Markdown's creators, to make a plain text to HTML
language, Markdown is now being used by more than just web developers.
Markdown can be used to take notes quickly, yet with the ability to
export into a share ready document, headers, lists and links included.

Markdown is actually easy to get started. You can open any text editor,
be it a full word processor like Word, or just the basic Notepad, and
start typing Markdown syntax. Unfortunately, you do not get any of the
nice to have features, such as syntax highlighting and auto-complete, of
the more tech minded text editors. Markdown writers quickly discover
having extra features makes the writing process quicker, shaving time
off of their production schedules.

One might assume that the problem becomes finding a text editor that can
support Markdown, isn't a full fledged development platform, and is
quick to setup. Turns out that is not the problem. The problem is that
there are too many such editors out there! This guide is here to
simplify the decision by showing how to setup a known, and tested, text
editor, Sublime Text 3, to write Markdown syntax.

*One last note, this guide is written assuming that the user is on a MacOS system. If that is not the case, the only difference is that CMD translates to CTRL on a Windows or Linux machine.*

### Using Markdown:

Now that Markdown and Markdown Preview are installed and working, here are some simple tips to get started on creating beautiful documents.

### Using Header
Headers are the foundation blocks of Markdown. They give visual indicators of when topics change, and can be linked to using hyperlinks.

A ***#*** denotes a header. A single ***#*** is an H1 header, which is the largest. Adding additional ***#*** will increment the header to the next smallest size.

1. Try an H1 size header
```markdown
# This is an H1 Header
```

2.  Try an H2 size header
```markdown
## This is an H2 Header
```

3.  Try an H3 size header
```markdown
### This is an H3 Header
```

**Output of Header examples:**

# This is an H1 Header
## This is an H2 Header
### This is an H3 Header

### Change font emphasis

Markdown also supports some font emphasis styles**Bold**, *Italic*, and ~~Strike Through~~ 

1.  Make text **Bold**
```markdown
**Bold**
```

2.  Make text *Italicized*
```markdown
*Italics*
```

3.  ~~Strike Through~~ text
```markdown
~~Strike Through~~
```

### Create Lists

Markdown supports both ordered, and unordered lists.

1.  Use * to create an unordered list
```markdown
* This is an unordered item
* This is another unordered item
    * This is a sub item
```

2.  Use numerals to create an ordered list
```markdown
1. This is an ordered item
2. This is another ordered item
    1. This is a sub item
```

3.  Ordered and unordered lists can be combined
```markdown
1. This is an ordered item
    * This is an unordered sub item
* This is an unordered item
    1. This is an ordered sub item
```

**Output of markdown lists:**
* This is an unordered item
* This is another unordered item
    * This is a sub item

1. This is an ordered item
2. This is another ordered item
    1. This is a sub item

1. This is an ordered item
    * This is an unordered sub item
* This is an unordered item
    1. This is an ordered sub item

## Conclusion
----------------

Markdown is a simple, intuitive, plain text language that has many uses. Web developers, programmers, students and academics use the language daily, but the language could be useful to an even wider range of writers. One of the biggest barriers to using Markdown is how many text editor options are available. Even the most minimal editor is sufficient to create a markdown document.

Unfortunately, minimalism has major drawbacks. Individuals who like more modern features, such as syntax highlighting, or are new to programing languages, require something more modern. Sublime Text 3 fits that role.

ST3 can be used as just a simple editor, but can also be equipped with packages that increase its value. As this guide has shown, ST3 is easily configured to become a powerful, and complete Markdown editor that suits anyone.
